IntelliGit brings the best Git workflow ideas from PyCharm, VS Code, and Visual Studio IDE into one VS Code extension: a real commit panel, a readable branch graph, branch actions where the history is, shelf-style parking for unfinished work, and merge-conflict tools that do not make you rebuild context from terminal output.

It does not try to replace Git. It gives the daily Git work a better cockpit.

## Why IntelliGit Exists

VS Code is fast and flexible, but Git work often ends up split across the Source Control view, terminal commands, diff tabs, branch pickers, and third-party graph extensions. That is fine for small changes. It gets tiring when you are shaping commits, checking history, moving branches, or cleaning up before a push.

IntelliGit pulls those workflows into one JetBrains-inspired surface:

- A focused commit panel for staging, rollback, amend, commit, and push.
- An actionable commit graph with branch and history operations.
- Shelf/stash and worktree workflows.
- A three-pane merge-conflict editor — **Yours, editable Result, and Theirs side by side**.
- **CI check status for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.**
- A unified workbench that can be moved to another monitor.

## Feature Gallery

### Three-Pane Merge Editor

![IntelliGit three-pane merge editor showing Yours, editable Result, and Theirs side by side](media/screenshots/three-pane-merge-editor.png)

Resolve complex conflicts without stacking or switching editors. Yours, the
editable Result, and Theirs stay visible side by side, with aligned conflict
bands, visual connectors, conflict navigation, and explicit apply or abort
controls.

### Commit Panel

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/screenshots/commit-panel.png" alt="IntelliGit commit panel with staged, changed, and unversioned files" width="70%" />
</p>

The commit panel keeps the daily commit loop in one focused view. Stage by file,
folder, or whole section; keep tracked changes and unversioned files separated;
review per-file status and line deltas; then commit, push, or amend without
leaving the Git surface. File context actions cover rollback, jump to source,
delete, shelve changes, show history, and refresh.

### Shelf Workflow

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/screenshots/shelf-workflow.png" alt="IntelliGit shelf workflow with apply, pop, drop, and show diff actions" width="70%" />
</p>

The Shelf/Stash tab is built for interrupted work. Park partial or full changes,
preview the files inside a shelved entry, show a diff before restoring it, then
apply, pop, or drop the entry from the same panel. This gives VS Code a workflow
closer to JetBrains shelf handling than raw terminal stash juggling.

### Shelve (Patch-Based)

**Shelve is separate from Git stash.** Stash remains Git-native; IntelliGit
Shelve captures selected working-tree changes as named patches, stores them
outside the repository, and can later restore them without changing stash
entries. Start from a changed-file context menu in the `Commit` panel, or use
the Command Palette commands `IntelliGit: Shelve Changes`, `IntelliGit: Shelve
Silently`, `IntelliGit: Save to Shelf`, `IntelliGit: Unshelve`, `IntelliGit:
Import Patch`, `IntelliGit: Clean Up Shelf`, and `IntelliGit: Purge Shelf
Recovery` (frees retained recovery snapshots ahead of their retention window).

The default **flattened** unshelve applies content to the working tree and
leaves the current index untouched. **Exact state** is an IntelliGit extension
that restores both staged and unstaged layers when their preconditions hold.
Untracked files are another visibly labeled IntelliGit extension; PyCharm's
unversioned-file behavior is not implied. A `.patch` export is flattened and
therefore lossy for staging metadata; full-fidelity data remains in IntelliGit's
internal shelf storage.

Shelf settings use these defaults:

- `intelligit.shelf.recordBaseRevisions`: `true`.
- `intelligit.shelf.path`: empty (use the default location); this override is
  machine-scoped.
- `intelligit.shelf.removeOnUnshelve`: `true`.
- `intelligit.shelf.recoveryRetentionHours`: `24` (minimum `1`).
- `intelligit.shelf.cleanupAfterDays`: `0` (never clean up automatically).

By default, storage is under VS Code `globalStorage`, in `shelves/<repoId>/`,
where `<repoId>` is derived from the normalized repository-root path hash. The
machine-scoped path override still appends that repository identifier. Shelf
patches are plaintext and can contain source or secrets: IntelliGit creates
shelf directories with `0700` permissions and files with `0600`, but this is
not encryption. See the [Shelf security notes](docs/shelve/security-notes.md)
before placing shelves on shared or synced storage.

### Commit Graph, Changed Files, And CI Checks

![IntelliGit commit graph with branch lanes, changed files, and commit check popover](media/screenshots/commit-checks.png)

The graph view combines branch search, branch lanes, commit search, changed
files, commit metadata, and CI/CD checks. Commit check badges show provider
status directly in history, and the popover exposes individual GitHub, GitLab,
Bitbucket Cloud, or Bitbucket Server checks with links back to the provider.

### Branch Actions

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/screenshots/branch-actions.png" alt="IntelliGit branch action menu in the commit graph" width="70%" />
</p>

Branch actions live where branch decisions happen. The branch tree groups
current, local, remote, and worktree branches, then exposes context-aware actions
such as checkout, new branch, checkout-and-rebase, rebase, merge, update, push,
rename, delete, and worktree creation.

### Commit Actions

![IntelliGit commit action menu with patch, cherry-pick, reset, revert, rebase, branch, and tag actions](media/screenshots/commit-actions.png)

Commit history is actionable, not read-only. Right-click a commit to copy its
hash, create a patch, cherry-pick, checkout the revision, reset the current
branch, revert, push up to that commit, undo, edit the message, squash, drop,
start an interactive rebase, create a branch, or create a tag. Risky actions are
guarded by context and confirmations.

### Interactively Rebase from Here

Right-click a commit and choose **Interactively Rebase from Here...** to rewrite
the commits from that point through `HEAD`. The dialog lists commits in Git's
todo order and lets you reorder them or choose `pick`, `reword`, `squash`,
`fixup`, or `drop` before IntelliGit starts Git's native interactive rebase.

If Git pauses for conflicts, resolve and stage the files, then use **Continue**;
use **Abort Rebase** to restore the pre-rebase branch and history. IntelliGit
warns when the selected range includes published commits and, after a successful
rewrite, offers **Force Push** for the affected branch. See the
[interactive rebase guide](docs/interactive-rebase/README.md) for session,
recovery, and safety details.

### Unified IntelliGit Workbench

![IntelliGit Undock picker with editor-tab and new-window options](media/screenshots/undock-workflow.png)

![Undocked IntelliGit workbench with commit panel, branch tree, graph, changed files, and details](media/screenshots/intelligit-workbench.png)

When you need room, IntelliGit can run as a unified workbench tab. The `Undock`
feature allows you to undock the Git window and move it to another screen. The
commit panel, branch tree, graph lanes, changed-file tree, and commit details
stay in one layout, with dock/undock support for monitor-heavy workflows.

Open **IntelliGit: Show Git Log**, then use the **Undock...** button in the Graph
view's toolbar to choose **Undock in Editor Tab** or **Undock in New Window**.
The button is available in both Graph views, including when the sidebar Graph
is moved into the bottom panel. With Graph in that panel, VS Code's existing
**Ctrl+J** shortcut (**Cmd+J** on macOS) toggles the panel; **Undock...** is the
button that opens the full workbench.

To show or hide this button, search VS Code Settings for
`intelligit.undockableWindowButtonVisability`. It defaults to `true`; set it to
`false` to hide the button in both Graph views. Both standard and color icons
are supported. This setting controls button visibility; `intelligit.undockableWindow`
controls whether **Show Git Log** opens the unified editor tab.

### Publish Branch

![IntelliGit publish branch provider picker for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, and Bitbucket Server](media/screenshots/publish-branch.png)

Publishing is not limited to pushing an existing remote. IntelliGit can create a
repository or project on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, or Bitbucket Server,
add the remote, and push the selected branch through one guided flow.

## Quick Start

1. Install IntelliGit.
2. Open a Git repository in VS Code.
3. Open IntelliGit from the activity bar.
4. Use the `Commit` tab to stage files and commit.
5. Open the bottom IntelliGit panel to inspect history, filter branches, and act on commits.

## Installation

Search for **IntelliGit** in VS Code Extensions, or install from:

- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaheshKok.intelligit)
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/MaheshKok/intelligit)

## Requirements

- VS Code `1.107.0` or later
- Git installed and available on `PATH`

## Settings

Configure IntelliGit from VS Code Settings or `settings.json`.

```jsonc
{
    // Enable tooltips inside IntelliGit webviews.
    "intelligit.tooltips.enabled": true,

    // Open IntelliGit as a unified editor tab when Show Git Log is invoked.
    "intelligit.undockableWindow": false,

    // Show the Undock... toolbar button in both Graph views; false hides it.
    "intelligit.undockableWindowButtonVisability": true,

    // Clear commit drafts after local commits; false retains the draft.
    "intelligit.clearLastCommit": true,

    // Icon style used in IntelliGit panels: "standard" or "color".
    "intelligit.icons": "standard",

    // Commit panel position inside the undocked/tabbed IntelliGit window: "auto", "left", or "right".
    "intelligit.commitWindowPosition": "auto",

    // Ask for a marketplace rating after IntelliGit has been used for a while.
    "intelligit.reviewPrompt.enabled": true,

    // Generate commit messages with GitHub Copilot (the default provider).
    "intelligit.commitMessageGeneration.provider": "copilot",

    // To use an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API instead, replace the provider value above
    // with "openaiCompatible" and add these settings. Replace placeholder values locally.
    // "intelligit.commitMessageGeneration.provider": "openaiCompatible",
    // "intelligit.commitMessageGeneration.openAi.baseUrl": "https://api.example.com/v1",
    // "intelligit.commitMessageGeneration.openAi.model": "your-model-id",
    // "intelligit.commitMessageGeneration.openAi.apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    // "intelligit.commitMessageGeneration.openAi.maxInputTokens": 8192,
}
```

The OpenAI-compatible API key is stored as plaintext in VS Code settings. Requests, including the API key and repository diff, are sent in transit and may be exposed to the configured HTTP endpoint, so use HTTPS and a trusted provider.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build
bun run watch
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run format
```

### Documentation Standards

Use the IntelliGit TSDoc standard in [docs/tsdocs/TSDOC.md](docs/tsdocs/TSDOC.md) when documenting exported or boundary-facing TypeScript/TSX symbols. Prefer comments that capture contracts, invariants, side effects, and trust boundaries over comments that repeat TypeScript types. The rollout plan is tracked in [docs/tsdocs/codex-tsdoc-rollout-plan.md](docs/tsdocs/codex-tsdoc-rollout-plan.md).

Contributor and reviewer checklist:

- Update TSDoc in the same change that adds or changes exported/boundary-facing TypeScript or TSX symbols.
- Reject comments that only restate types, use vague verbs such as "handles" or "returns", or describe behavior that is no longer true.
- Keep the source documentation ratchet enabled; do not weaken lint enforcement to land undocumented exports.
- During release maintenance, scan for stale `@todo`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `@deprecated`, and `@remarks` notes in `src` and `docs`.

### Manual Extension Test

```bash
bun install
bun run build
bun run package
code --install-extension intelligit-*.vsix
```

### Test Suite

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests.
bun run test

# Watch mode.
bun run test -- --watch

# Run a specific test file.
bun run test -- tests/unit/gitops.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern.
bun run test -- -t "CommitPanelApp"
```

## Architecture

```text
GitExecutor (src/git/executor.ts — spawns the Git binary directly)
    |
GitOps (operations layer)
    |
View Providers (extension host orchestration)
    |
Webviews (React apps for commit panel and commit graph)
```

Data flow highlights:

1. Commit selection in the graph requests commit details from the extension host and updates the detail pane.
2. Branch selection filters the graph and clears stale commit detail state.
3. Commit panel file count updates the activity badge.
4. Refresh reloads branch state, history, and commit panel data together.
